## About The Project

![Screen Shot](bannerreadme.png)

I have been tasked with creating a website for the Avondale College shop because they do not currently have a website, and it would be of great service to the school if they had one. I need to make a website that is able to be accessed by possibly hundreds each day, and that is easy to use by the general public as it’d be a first glance of the schools uniform which is an important image.

Currently the college has a small blurb on their main website that’s hidden inside a bunch of submenus, that only say “We have a uniform shop, here’s when its open, you need to come and visit to see any of the products and prices we have.” That’s not very user friendly, so I wanted to change this and make it as nice as possible to use. Ideally by the end of this, I’ll have a site that gives the customer the ability to place orders to be picked up, and possibly even a way to pay for it online too.


## Built With

ASP.NET Core

## Getting Started

Below are instructions for getting a local version of the shop to run for debugging.

### Installation

1. Download Zip file
2. Open file in Visual Studio (2022+ recommended)
3. Run the command "update-database" in the NuGet Package Manager Console
5. Run/Debug to start localhost site.
